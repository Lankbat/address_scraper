This python script parses the html elements returned by the results from the website https://lookups.melissa.com/home/addresssearch/ and puts the data in an excel sheet.
The bottom results of the excel file are due to the html elements having the same name as what we actually want to parse. 
Libraries that are needed for this code to run are beautifulsoup4, requests, and openpyxl
